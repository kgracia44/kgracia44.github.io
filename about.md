I am named Kelly. I began my journey into Data Science Learning at General Assembly in June 2016. This Data Science Immersive (DSI) program has been intense, challenging, and extremely enlightening. See how I progress in skill and knowledge by checking out my weekly blog posts, which are reports over my weekly projects for the summer program. I began as an absolute beginner, and although I have so, so (so, so) much left to learn and dive in deeper, I have gained so much already.
