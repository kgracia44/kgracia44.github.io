title: APIs + Random Forests -- Exploring What Factors Contribute to Ratings
---

Executive Summary

The aim of this report is to acquire data from IMDB, and examine what factors lead to certain ratings for movies. This report will conclude with findings and recommendations.

If you are really interested in exploring what factors lead to high ratings for movies, or you are a movie fanatic, this blog post will hold a lot of interesting findings for you! So be sure to check back on Sunday of this week for a full-fledged analysis report over what does it take to be a good movie in the eyes of the massses.

Introduction


-blurb about Netflix and it's new goals/project goals. Statement of importance. 
-Briefly discuss where data was acquired and focus of project (namely internet user critics, not according to movie critics)
-Quickly discuss reasoning for tree-based model....

Frequently after a disaster, researchers and firms will come in to give an independent review of an incident. Even if these agencies do not have current client data that it can use to test and deploy models, they can use historical data to create models for future purposes. In this post, I will demonstrate how data from the 1912 titanic disaster stored in a remote database can be used to test and deploy predictive models, particularly classification models, for disaster analysis.

In this project, I set up a connection to a remote database and conducted querys (using Python). After performing EDA, I proceeded to construct a logistic regression model as well as a kNN model and test/validate their results. Using several features of a passenger, I attempted to predict a corresponding classification (survivor or non-survivor) for that passenger. 

Although most job listings do not come with salary information, salary information that is available can be used to extrapolate expected salaries for other listings. One way to gauge salary amounts is to take a look at what industry factors influence the pay scale for specific professionals and determine what leads to high/low salary. 

In this project, I collected salary information on data science jobs in a variety of markets. Then using the location and title of the job, I attempted to predict a corresponding salary classification (high or low) for that job. 

Aggregators like Indeed.com regularly pool job postings from a variety of markets and industries. By using data collected by scraping Indeed.com, a binary predictor with Logistic Regression was built to find factors that most directly impact data science salaries in metro regions.
