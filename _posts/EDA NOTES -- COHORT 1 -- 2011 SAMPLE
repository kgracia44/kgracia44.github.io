Summary of Distributions of Demographics:

- California population in sample is an outlier; however, it is proportional to the baseline pop/sampling frame for CA

- Gender 49 v 51 ==> Basically equally dist

- Education Level at Baseline:
    - About 1/3 of the youth in the sample are in grades that are 3+ yrs away from graduating high school, and so are unlikely to be at a point where they can enroll in higher education (a target) when first outcomes follow-up survey is administered (2 yrs from baseline year). However, there are exceptions and enrollment in vocational training/trade schools is still possible in 2 yrs.

- About 1/5 of the youth in the sample have been labeled as delinquints

- 93% of the sample are not in a Tribe. Unless bivariate analysis shows any interesting correlation with this variable, may be able to drop this variable.

- About 1/4 of the youth in sample have received Special Education Services
